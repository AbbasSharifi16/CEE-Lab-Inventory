# CEE Lab Equipment Manager - Authentication System Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive user authentication and authorization system for your CEE Lab Equipment Manager. Here's what has been added:

## 🔐 Authentication Features

### 1. **User Roles & Permissions**
- **Admin**: Full access to all labs and equipment, plus user management capabilities
- **Grant Users**: Full access to all labs and equipment (like admins but without user management)
- **Faculty Members**: Limited access only to their assigned labs

### 2. **Login System**
- **Login Page**: Beautiful, professional login interface
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing for secure password storage
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure authentication tokens with 24-hour expiration
- **Auto-redirect**: Unauthenticated users automatically redirect to login

### 3. **User Management (Admin Only)**
- **Add Users**: Admin can register new users with role assignment
- **Email Invitations**: Automatic email invites sent to new users
- **Password Setup**: Secure password setup process for new users
- **User List**: View all registered users with their details
- **Delete Users**: Remove users when needed

### 4. **Lab Access Control**
- **Lab Filtering**: Faculty users only see equipment from their authorized labs
- **Lab Selection**: Admins/Grant users can access all labs
- **API Security**: All equipment access is filtered by user permissions

## 🚀 New Files Created

1. **`login.html`** - Professional login page
2. **`setup-password.html`** - Password setup for new users
3. **`admin.html`** - User management panel (admin only)
4. **`server-auth.js`** - New authentication server

## 🔧 Modified Files

1. **`package.json`** - Added authentication dependencies
2. **`index.html`** - Updated header layout for user info and buttons
3. **`script.js`** - Added authentication checks and API token handling
4. **`styles.css`** - Enhanced header styles for new layout

## 📋 Default Admin Account

**Email**: `admin@fiu.edu`  
**Password**: `admin123`  
**Role**: Admin  
**Access**: All labs  

⚠️ **Important**: Change this password after first login!

## 🎯 How to Use

### For Administrators:
1. Login with default admin credentials
2. Click "Admin Panel" button in header
3. Add new users by filling the form
4. Specify user role and authorized labs
5. New users receive email invitations

### For Faculty Members:
1. Receive email invitation from admin
2. Click setup link to create password
3. Login with email and new password
4. Access only authorized lab equipment

### For Grant Users:
1. Same process as faculty but with full lab access
2. Can view and manage all equipment
3. Cannot access admin user management

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Password Requirements**: Strong password validation
- **Token Expiration**: 24-hour login sessions
- **Role-based Access**: Strict lab access control
- **API Authentication**: All API calls require valid tokens
- **XSS Protection**: Secure token storage and validation

## 🌐 Lab Authorization

Users can be assigned to specific labs:
- EC3625
- EC3630  
- EC3760
- EC3765
- OU107
- OU106

## 📱 User Interface Updates

- **Header**: Shows user info and authorized labs
- **Admin Button**: Appears only for admin users
- **Logout Button**: Easy logout functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens + bcrypt
- **Email**: Nodemailer (requires SMTP configuration)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern authentication flow

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Email Configuration**: Update `emailConfig` in server-auth.js with your SMTP settings
2. **Production Security**: Change JWT_SECRET in production environment
3. **HTTPS**: Enable secure cookies when using HTTPS
4. **Backup**: The system creates users in the same database as equipment

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

The system is now running on `http://localhost:3000` with full authentication. You can:

1. Login as admin to test the system
2. Add faculty members and grant users
3. Test lab access restrictions
4. Manage users through the admin panel

Your lab equipment management system now has enterprise-level user authentication and authorization! 🎉
