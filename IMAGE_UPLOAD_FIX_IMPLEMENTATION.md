# Image Upload Fix Implementation

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing an "Unexpected token '<'" error when changing equipment images in the popup window and saving changes. This error typically occurs when the client expects JSON but receives HTML (like an error page).

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by several problems:

1. **Missing Equipment Endpoints**: The `server-auth.js` file (authentication-enabled server) was missing the equipment CRUD endpoints (POST, PUT, GET by ID). It only had the GET all equipment endpoint.

2. **Database API Mismatch**: The equipment endpoints that were copied from `server.js` used the `sqlite3` API (with callbacks), but `server-auth.js` uses the `better-sqlite3` API (synchronous).

3. **Missing Fields in FormData**: The `uploadEquipmentImage` function in `script.js` was not including all required fields (`model`, `fiuId`, `manualLink`) when updating equipment with a new image.

4. **Poor Error Handling**: The client-side error handling was attempting to parse HTML error responses as JSON, causing the "Unexpected token '<'" error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Fixes (server-auth.js)

Added missing equipment endpoints with proper `better-sqlite3` API usage:

- **GET /api/equipment/:id** - Fetch single equipment item with user access control
- **POST /api/equipment** - Create new equipment with image upload support
- **PUT /api/equipment/:id** - Update equipment with image upload support

All endpoints include:
- User authentication via JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (admin/grant have full access, faculty limited to authorized labs)
- Proper validation of required fields
- Better error handling with descriptive error messages
- User tracking (created_by, updated_by fields)

### 2. Client-Side Fixes (script.js)

#### Enhanced Error Handling
```javascript
if (!response || !response.ok) {
    let errorMessage = `HTTP error! status: ${response?.status || 'Network error'}`;
    try {
        const contentType = response.headers.get('content-type');
        if (contentType && contentType.includes('application/json')) {
            const errorData = await response.json();
            errorMessage = errorData.error || errorMessage;
        } else {
            // If it's not JSON, try to get text
            const errorText = await response.text();
            console.error('Non-JSON error response:', errorText);
            if (errorText.includes('<!DOCTYPE') || errorText.includes('<html>')) {
                errorMessage = 'Server returned an HTML error page. Check server logs.';
            } else {
                errorMessage = errorText || errorMessage;
            }
        }
    } catch (parseError) {
        console.error('Error parsing error response:', parseError);
        errorMessage = `HTTP ${response?.status || 'Unknown'} error - Unable to parse response`;
    }
    throw new Error(errorMessage);
}
```

#### Fixed uploadEquipmentImage Function
Added missing fields to FormData:
```javascript
formData.append('model', equipment.model || '');
formData.append('fiuId', equipment.fiuId || '');
formData.append('manualLink', equipment.manualLink || '');
```

### 3. Database Schema Updates
Ensured that the equipment update SQL includes the `updated_by` field:
```sql
UPDATE equipment 
SET name = ?, category = ?, model = ?, lab = ?, buyingDate = ?, serialNumber = ?, fiuId = ?,
    quantity = ?, price = ?, status = ?, notes = ?, image = ?, manualLink = ?, 
    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_by = ?
WHERE id = ?
```

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **server-auth.js** - Added equipment CRUD endpoints with better-sqlite3 API
2. **script.js** - Enhanced error handling and fixed uploadEquipmentImage function
3. **server.js** - Updated validation and error handling (for reference)

### Endpoints Added to server-auth.js:
- `GET /api/equipment/:id` - Fetch single equipment
- `POST /api/equipment` - Create equipment  
- `PUT /api/equipment/:id` - Update equipment

## Testing Results
✅ Equipment update functionality now works correctly
✅ Image upload and replacement works without errors
✅ Proper JSON error responses instead of HTML error pages
✅ All required fields are properly included in update requests
✅ User access control and validation working correctly

## Benefits
1. **Better User Experience**: Users now get clear, actionable error messages instead of cryptic JavaScript errors
2. **Improved Reliability**: Proper validation prevents incomplete data submissions
3. **Enhanced Security**: Role-based access control ensures users can only modify equipment in their authorized labs
4. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive error logging helps identify issues quickly

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing optimistic updates to improve perceived performance
- Add client-side validation to prevent unnecessary server requests
- Implement image compression to reduce upload times
- Add progress indicators for image uploads
