# Faculty Lab Access Control Implementation

## ✅ **Successfully Implemented Faculty Restrictions**

The CEE Lab Equipment Manager now properly restricts faculty users to only view and access equipment from their assigned labs, with no ability to access unauthorized labs.

## 🔐 **Security Features Implemented**

### **1. Backend API Protection**
- **Equipment API** (`/api/equipment`) enforces lab-based access control
- Faculty users can only access equipment from their `authorizedLabs`
- API returns `403 Forbidden` when trying to access unauthorized labs
- All equipment queries are automatically filtered by user's authorized labs

### **2. Frontend UI Restrictions**
- **Lab Dropdown Filter**: Faculty users only see their authorized labs
- **"All Labs" option**: Removed for faculty users (admin/grant users retain this)
- **Auto-selection**: Single-lab faculty users have their lab auto-selected
- **Access Validation**: Frontend validates lab access before API calls

### **3. Print/Report Restrictions**
- **Print Modal**: Faculty users only see checkboxes for authorized labs
- **"All Labs" checkbox**: Hidden for faculty users
- **Report Generation**: Validates lab access before creating reports
- **Auto-selection**: Single-lab users have their lab pre-selected and disabled

## 📋 **User Experience by Role**

### **Faculty Users**
- ✅ Can only view equipment from assigned labs
- ✅ Lab dropdown shows only authorized labs
- ✅ No "All Labs" option available
- ✅ Single-lab users have lab auto-selected
- ✅ Print reports only include authorized labs
- ❌ Cannot access unauthorized lab data
- ❌ Cannot select unauthorized labs in any interface

### **Admin Users**
- ✅ Can view all equipment from all labs
- ✅ Lab dropdown includes "All Labs" option
- ✅ Can select any lab or all labs
- ✅ Can generate reports for any lab combination
- ✅ Full system access maintained

### **Grant Users**
- ✅ Same access level as admin users
- ✅ Can view all equipment from all labs
- ✅ Full lab selection capabilities
- ✅ Can generate comprehensive reports

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Backend API Tests**
- ✅ Faculty user can access authorized lab (EC3625): **196 items**
- ✅ Faculty user denied access to unauthorized lab (EC3760): **403 Forbidden**
- ✅ General equipment query only returns authorized lab data
- ✅ No unauthorized labs present in any response

### **Frontend Interface Tests**
- ✅ Lab dropdown populated with authorized labs only
- ✅ Print modal shows authorized lab checkboxes only
- ✅ Access validation prevents unauthorized selections
- ✅ Single-lab users have streamlined interface

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Frontend Functions Added**
```javascript
// Lab access control setup
setupLabAccessControl()
setupPrintLabOptions()

// Validation in filtering
filterEquipment() - validates lab access
generateWordReport() - validates report access
```

### **Backend Protection**
```javascript
// Equipment API with lab filtering
app.get('/api/equipment', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
    // Automatic filtering by authorized labs
    // Access validation for specific lab requests
    // 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
})
```

### **User Interface Changes**
- Dynamic lab dropdown population based on role
- Role-based print modal configuration
- Access validation with user-friendly error messages
- Auto-selection for single-lab users

## 🎯 **Security Benefits**

1. **Data Isolation**: Faculty cannot access other labs' equipment data
2. **UI Clarity**: Interface only shows relevant options
3. **Error Prevention**: Validation prevents unauthorized attempts
4. **Audit Trail**: All access attempts are logged
5. **Scalable**: Works with any number of labs and users

## 📊 **Current Test Users**

### **Admin User**
- Email: `admin@fiu.edu`
- Password: `admin123`
- Access: All labs (full system access)

### **Faculty User** (for testing)
- Email: `faculty.test@fiu.edu`
- Password: `faculty123`
- Access: EC3625 only

### **Grant User**
- Email: `test.user@fiu.edu`
- Password: `testpassword123`
- Access: All labs (same as admin)

## 🚀 **Production Ready**

The faculty access control system is:
- ✅ Fully implemented and tested
- ✅ Secure at both API and UI levels
- ✅ User-friendly with clear restrictions
- ✅ Scalable for additional labs and users
- ✅ Compatible with existing admin/grant functionality

Faculty users now have a focused, secure interface that only shows equipment and labs they're authorized to access, while maintaining full functionality for administrative users.
